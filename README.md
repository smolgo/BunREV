# BunREV is a NIS decompiler/parser
----------------------------------
This was specifically made for Need for Speed: Carbonâ„¢\
I can not guarantee functionality with the other games, as I won't bother to test it

## To do:
- Make this in a lower language
- Include parsing for the result binary files
- Eat a gilled cheese mmm
